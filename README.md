# Project 1

## Title:📊 NHS Accident & Emergency (A&E) Analysis

## Tools Used:
   - **Power BI Desktop** – for building interactive dashboards and visualizations  
   - **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – to create dynamic KPIs, calculated measures, and business logic  
   - **Power Query (M Language)** – for data cleaning, transformation, and shaping before visualization
  
## Project Description:

   This project presents a comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing NHS Accident and Emergency (A&E) data from January 1, 2021 to January 30, 2025. It visualizes critical     KPIs such as total attendances, emergency admissions, and wait time performance across provider trusts and department types.

   The dashboard is divided into two main sections for targeted analysis:

**Accident Dashboard**
  Focuses on attendance trends, 4-hour wait targets, and provider-specific delays.

**Emergency Dashboard**
  Highlights emergency admissions, departmental performance, and provider-level comparisons.

  **Key findings:**

**🚑 Accident Dashboard – Key Findings**
   4-Hour Wait Time Performance

  Only 69% of A&E patients are seen within the 4-hour NHS target — significantly below the 95% benchmark, highlighting ongoing challenges in timely emergency care.

  Year-over-Year Performance Trends

  Performance declined from 70% in 2021 to 63% in 2022, likely due to service strain.

  Improvements followed: 69% in 2023, rising to 73% in 2024 and early 2025.

  This upward trend indicates recovery, possibly due to operational changes or resource improvements.

  Worst-Performing NHS Trusts

  The highest delay rates (patients waiting over 4 hours) were seen at:

  Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust – 45%

  Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust – 43%

  University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust – 42%

  These figures suggest localized issues like overcrowding or staff shortages.

**Departmental Performance**

  Minor Injury Units and Specialty Departments outperform Major A&E departments in meeting the 4-hour target.

  Major A&E departments have higher delays due to higher volume and case complexity.

# 🏥 Emergency Dashboard – Key Findings
**Emergency Admission Trends**

  Emergency admissions increased steadily from 2021 to 2024, with high levels continuing into early 2025.

  This rise is driven by factors such as an aging population and chronic illness, signaling increasing demand for emergency services.

  Service Responsiveness

  A modest improvement in NHS responsiveness begins in 2024.

  However, the rising number of admissions continues to strain resources, and overall performance still falls short of the 95% target.
