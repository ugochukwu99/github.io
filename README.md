# Project Description:

   This project presents a comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing NHS Accident and Emergency (A&E) data from January 1, 2021 to January 30, 2025. It visualizes critical     KPIs such as total attendances, emergency admissions, and wait time performance across provider trusts and department types.

   The dashboard is divided into two main sections for targeted analysis:

**Accident Dashboard**
  Focuses on attendance trends, 4-hour wait targets, and provider-specific delays.

**Emergency Dashboard**
  Highlights emergency admissions, departmental performance, and provider-level comparisons.

  **Key findings:**
  
  _**Accident Dashboard**_

  What percentage of A&E patients are seen within 4 hours?
  
From the KPI card displayed in the Accident dashboard, 69% of patients were seen within the 4-hour NHS target window. While this represents the majority of cases, it still falls short of the NHS‚Äôs benchmark of 95%, indicating ongoing challenges in timely patient care delivery.

How has that performance changed year-over-year?

The data shows a clear performance trajectory over the five-year period. In 2021, 70% of patients were seen within the NHS‚Äôs 4-hour target. This percentage declined to 63% in 2022, likely reflecting increased strain on emergency services during that time. Encouragingly, the trend then reverses: performance improves to 69% in 2023, and further strengthens to 73% in both 2024 and early 2025. This upward trend suggests that operational adjustments, resource investments, or improved triage processes have positively impacted service delivery. While the current rate still falls below the NHS‚Äôs national 95% target, the consistent year-over-year improvement is a positive signal of recovery and system responsiveness.

Which NHS providers have the highest proportions of patients delayed beyond 4 hours?

The bar chart highlights several NHS trusts with a high percentage of patients waiting beyond the 4-hour target. Notably, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust leads with 45% of patients delayed, followed closely by The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust (43%) and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (42%). These elevated delay rates may reflect systemic challenges such as overcrowding, staff shortages, or bed availability issues. Identifying these trusts enables targeted performance improvement initiatives and resource planning to address bottlenecks in urgent care delivery.

Which types of departments (e.g., Major A&E, Minor Injury, Specialty) handle wait times better?

According to the chart Minor Injury Units and Specialty Departments generally perform better, with fewer breaches of the 4-hour target. Major A&E departments tend to have higher delays, likely due to the complexity and volume of cases handled.

 _**Emergency Dashboard**_
 
Are emergency admissions rising or falling over the four-year period?

The "Emergency Admission by Year" chart shows a consistent and measurable increase in emergency admissions from 2021 through 2024, with levels remaining high into early 2025. This sustained rise reflects growing pressure on emergency services, driven by identifiable factors such as an aging population, higher prevalence of chronic conditions. The data clearly signals that demand for emergency care is intensifying, and providers must scale capacity and triage systems to keep pace.

Has the NHS improved its responsiveness and service levels?

From a combined view of the trend charts and admission data, the NHS shows a modest improvement in responsiveness beginning in 2024. However, the increase in admissions has likely placed additional strain on resources, and overall performance remains below the national 95% compliance target.

# Project 2

**Title:** NHS Workforce Data Interrogation and Manipulation

**SQL Code:**
[NHS Workforce Code](https://github.com/ugochukwu99/github.io/blob/main/NHS_Workforce.SQL)

**SQL Skills Used:**
Data Retrieval (SELECT): Queried and extracted specific information from the database.
Data Aggregation (SUM, COUNT): Calculated totals, such as sales and quantities, and counted records to analyze data trends.
Data Filtering (WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, AND): Applied filters to select relevant data, including filtering by ranges and lists.
Data Source Specification (FROM): Specified the tables used as data sources for retrieval

**Project Description:**
This project involves analyzing NHS workforce data using SQL to uncover trends, workforce distribution, and staff group insights over time. The goal is to use structured queries to filter, aggregate, and interpret the data, supporting data-driven understanding of NHS staffing patterns.


**Technology used:** SQL server


# Project 3

**Title:**  NHS Hospital Admission Analysis 

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel, Pivot Chart, Pivot Table, Slicers, Conditional Formatting,

**Project Description:**
This project presents a visual analysis of hospital admission trends within the NHS, providing key insights on patient demographics, regional activity, diagnosis trends, and hospital performance. The dashboard was built to support data-driven decision-making for healthcare providers and administrators.

**Key findings:**
- Which diagnosis is mostly likely to require out of region care?

  The dataset indicates that stroke is the most frequent diagnosis linked to out-of-region care, ranking in the top two    diagnoses for four out of the six hospitals included in the analysis. This trend likely reflects the urgent nature of stroke cases, where patients are transported to the nearest available facility regardless of regional boundaries to ensure immediate treatment. While the pattern is clear, it's important to note that the dataset is limited in size.

- What is the busiest admission day of the week across all hospitals? How does its average length of stay compare to the quietest day?

  Friday saw the highest admissions (23), topping 5 of 6 hospitals, while Saturday was the quietest (8). This pattern aligns    with healthcare trends: patients often avoid weekend stays, and specialist services may be reduced. Yet, Friday‚Äôs average     length of stay (8 days) is identical to Saturday‚Äôs and just two hours more than Monday‚Äôs, falling within an hour of five      other days. This suggests that while patient volumes vary, case complexity and care duration remain stable‚Äîkey for planning   staffing and skill mix ahead of weekend surges.
